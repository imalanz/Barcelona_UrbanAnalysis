## Introduction.

This analysis aims to identify the best neighborhood to live in Barcelona based on several urban characteristics. A good place to live should provide a tranquil environment, good conditions for health, security, and mobility, and encourage outdoor activities.

## Process.

To conduct this analysis, I obtained data from Barcelona Open Data through CSV and web scraping. I cleaned and merged the data to derive meaningful insights. I focused on the ecological environment as it contributes to a healthier and happier way of life.

## Key Findings.

- Green spaces: Barcelona is striving to become a greener city, which is crucial for the well-being of its residents. To achieve this, the city is creating more public spaces, including parks in the streets, and reducing car usage.

- Clean air: Trees help filter the air, and reducing car usage can significantly reduce pollution. This is particularly important in a densely populated city like Barcelona.

- Accessibility: The city is encouraging walkability and connectivity through public transportation, making it more enjoyable for residents to move around.

- Community engagement: A strong sense of community can create a safer environment, particularly if everyone knows each other. Therefore, neighborhoods with community activities and support systems are ideal.

## Conclution.

To determine the best neighborhood, I merged data frames and calculated the density of each point. Using an urban criteria, I multiplied and summed the results to determine the best neighborhood. Based on my analysis, Pedralbes is the most healthy neighborhood in Barcelona. Sant Pere and Catalina follow closely, with Poble Sec ranking third due to Mont Juic's green areas. This analysis was made possible by the data provided by Barcelona Open Data.
